        <h2>Hello from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands</h2>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Welcome one and all to my corner of the internet. My name is Jordan Albany Toussaint and I am on a track to
          become an
          elemntary school librarian and media specialist. Currently, I am a fourth grade teacher here on the island
          of St. croix where I grew up. If you are unfamiliar with the Caribbean region, the U.S. Virgin Islands is made
          up of four main islands of which St. Croix is the largest and affectionately called the "Big island" or "Twin
          City"
          for its two grid-like twin like cities. The U.S. Virgin Islands not to be confused with the British Virgin
          Islands was
          purchasd on March 31, 1917 by the United States from Denmark for a whopping $25 million in gold. Seven Flags
          have flown over
          St. Croix, each adding their piece to our history. </p>
        <p> Fun fact! We have reatined many Danish customs like driving on the left side of the road.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I was convinced that I wanted to be medical doctor and followed that path into college. I quickly
          realized it was not for me, and
          majored in elementeray education K-6 at Barry University in Miami Shores, FL and graduated with a TESOL and
          reading endorsements. While I had the opportunity
          to teach in Miami after my student teaching, I chose to return home to teach. After a few years the local oil
          refinery shut down and enrollment at
          my private school dwindled. I used this opportunity to relocated to
          Charlotte, NC and taught third grade there before
          returning back to St. Croix, where I have been teaching for the past ten years at the Pearl B. Larsen K-8
          school. For more of my professional experiences view my resume above.
